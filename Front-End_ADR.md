#Front End implementation

# Title

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The front-end implementation of a web application is a key aspect and contains much of the code for a web app. Our front-end must adhere to the general object oriented principles 
and design patterns that we have been practicing during this term, thus our decisions must reflect this requirement. As we are creating an application from scratch, and as it is 
the presentation of the development teams hard work, it is important to choose the correct framework and technologies in order to achieve a design that is not only suitable 
for the application, but also highlights its features. 

## Decision

In order to implement an MVC-based design pattern for structuring our user interface as part of our play web application, we chose to use jQuery as a front-end 
framework along with HTML and CSS to achieve the design that the team envisioned.

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
