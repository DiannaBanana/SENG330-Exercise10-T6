#Front-End of the App

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The front-end implementation of a web application is a key aspect and contains much of the code for a web app. Our front-end must adhere to the general object oriented principles 
and design patterns that we have been practicing during this term, thus our decisions must reflect this requirement. As we are creating an application from scratch, and as it is 
the presentation of the development teams hard work, it is important to choose the correct framework and technologies in order to achieve a design that is not only suitable 
for the application, but also highlights its features. 

## Working with jQuery, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In order to implement an MVC-based design pattern for structuring our user interface as part of our play web application, we chose to use jQuery as a front-end 
framework along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to achieve the design that the team envisioned. We began with creating several HTML files located in the views package to 
render the information stored in our model as well as present user requests made through our controllers into a usable and aesthetically pleasing interface. We quickly realized that
an important aspect of our web app will be the navigation menu that is located on the left side of every page. This navigation menu would allow a user to navigate with ease through the
app. Another core component of several pages of our web app is the `ObservationTable.scala.html` and panels containing form-fields, text/input-fields, buttons as well as instructions to 
guide the users work-flow. We aimed for our design to guide the user to first add an observation either by clicking the `Add Observation` button on the home page or by clicking the 
`Add Observation` navigation panel in the navigation menu. From here, a user shall then create an observation through the `Create Observation` form that we drafted up using Scala Form Helpers.
Once an observation is created, a user will be redirected to a page containing that Observation Table as well as the `whaleForm.scala.html` that is used to handle the whales the user
will create. We chose to have each whale be presented as a card deck, with each "card" (whale) showing an image of that whale's species, its gender, estimated weight, and ID in order to visually 
see all entered whales. 

We created numerous templates for different interface elements. In order to make the site as composable as possible,
UI blocks were separated into smaller pieces so that they could be used on multiple pages. The consistent look and feel
of the site is achieved by making every page ultimately render `htmlHeader.scala.html` with the content section
being passed as a constructor parameter. Using Scala functional interfaces meant that it is easy to make repeated data.
As an example of this, the table of whales is generated by flat mapping observations and whales into tuples which can
then be mapped into a Twirl template which uses the appropriate file to visually render the information.
