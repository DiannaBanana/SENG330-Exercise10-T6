We found that adding separate commits for each deliverable was quite difficult, as we continuously had to work on
separate parts of the application in parallel. Thus, with each commit and respective improvement, the code and 
application continued to drastically change. In order to work around this challenge, we have added a relevant commit
with regard to the required deliverable as well as a commit to the final version. 

Please note that for deliverable #8, the links are for each ADR, respectively.
Please also note that for required deliverable #1, the sha1 codes are for the bonus of hosting the application on Heroku.
